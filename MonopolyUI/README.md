# Banking UI for Monopoly

This was a simple banking application from the course to learn and practice using arrays methods in Javascript. 
Small changes were subsequently added so it can be better suited for Monopoly so players can keep track of their accounts digitally.

Instructions:
There are only 4 accounts so this UI can only be used for a monopoly game with a maximum of 4 players.
Money can be transferred to other accounts by keying in the respective username and desired amount.
Each player can log into his account with the following username and password respectively: 

Account 1:
Username: js
Password: 1111

Account 2:
Username: jd
Password: 2222

Account 3:
Username: stw
Password: 3333

Account 4:
Username: ss
Password: 4444


*This application has many limitations but i intend to keep building on it and incorporate new features as i learn more advanced Javascript along the way.
